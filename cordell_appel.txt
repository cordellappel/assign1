I am from Bozeman MT and currently at my third year here at the University. The concept of version control is new to me as of this class so it may take me a little bit to get used to it but I’m eager to learn! My hobbies are board games, watching tv, and yard games. I’m busy from 10-1 on Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-2 on Tuesday and Thursday, and 10-4 on Friday.
